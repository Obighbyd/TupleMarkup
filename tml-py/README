What is TML?

	TML (Tuple Markup Language)
	github.com/judnich/TupleMarkup

	An extremely simple all-purpose markup language: nested lists with 
	bracket-minimizing syntax. It enables XML-like and YAML-like semantics 
	within the same clean and consistent language, plus much more.


What's in this folder? 

	This folder contains a TML parser API in Python.

	Parsing TML data in Python is as simple as passing a TML string to
	tml.parse(), which returns the parsed data object.

	Just as TML consists of nested lists and strings, the object tml.parse() 
	returns will consist of nested lists and strings. For example, parsing the
	TML  string "[abc 123 [hello] xyz]" returns an object equivalent to the
	Python literal: "['abc', '123', ['hello'], 'xyz']". Despite TML's name,
	this parser doesn't return data as nested *tuples* mainly because there's 
	no reason to make the data immutable (and Python tuples are immutable).
