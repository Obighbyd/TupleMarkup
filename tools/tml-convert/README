What is TML?

	TML (Tuple Markup Language)
	github.com/judnich/TupleMarkup

	An extremely simple all-purpose markup language: nested lists with 
	bracket-minimizing syntax. It enables XML-like and YAML-like semantics 
	within the same clean and consistent language.


What's in this folder?

	This folder contains tml-convert, a command-line tool for converting 
	XML files to TML files, and vice versa.

How does it work?

	You may notice that while XML includes special syntax to express element
	tag names, attribute names and values, and data within element tags, TML
	does not. Ultimately, TML is just nested lists. So how do we convert XML
	to TML and vice versa?

	TML document tree APIs (the API that allows you to traverse the nested
	lists / items) provide a powerful pattern matching feature that allows
	you to define virtually any data semantics / organization you want.

	In this case, we expect a certain pattern of TML nodes to express the
	data structure of an XML element. For example, the XML element:

		<tag-name attrib="val">content</name>

	Would be translated into the following TML:

		[tag-name [attrib val1] | content]

	The pattern is simple. Every XML element represented in TML is 
	formatted with markup on the left of the divider, and content on the
	right. The left markup begins with the element name, followed by
	a number of attributes (if any). An attribute name-value pair is 
	surrounded with brackets, where the first word within is the attribute
	name and everything following is the value.

Installation

	tml-convert requires Libxml2 for XML parsing. Once this is installed, 
	type "build" from this folder ("tools/tml-convert/").
