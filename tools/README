What is TML?

	TML (Tuple Markup Language)
	github.com/judnich/TupleMarkup

	An extremely simple all-purpose markup language: nested lists with 
	bracket-minimizing syntax. It enables XML-like and YAML-like semantics 
	within the same clean and consistent language.


What's in this folder? 

	This folder contains tml-convert, a command-line tool for converting 
	XML files to TML files, and vice versa.

Installation

	tml-convert requires Libxml2 for XML parsing. Once this is installed, 
	go to "tml-convert/" and type "build".
