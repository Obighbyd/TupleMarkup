What is TML?

	TML (Tuple Markup Language)
	github.com/judnich/TupleMarkup

	A minimalist all-purpose markup language: nested lists with
	bracket-minimizing syntax. It enables XML-like and YAML-like semantics 
	within the same clean and consistent language, plus much more.

TML Tools

	The subfolders here contain tools to make transitioning to and working
	with TML as easy as possible. Below are some brief descriptions of each.

tml-convert

	A command-line tool for converting XML files to TML files, and vice versa.
