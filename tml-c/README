What is TML?

	TML (Tuple Markup Language)
	github.com/judnich/TupleMarkup

    An extremely simple all-purpose markup language: nested lists with 
    bracket-minimizing syntax. It enables JSON-like and XML-like semantics 
    within the same clean and consistent language, plus much more.


What is this folder? 

	This folder contains a TML parser and utilities implemented in C.

	The parser is written to be extremely memory efficient and fast. Memory usage
	is so compact, this could be easily modified to be used in embedded systems 
	where malloc() is not used at all (parsing data structures are written and packed
	into a single internal data buffer).

	It should be compatible with any C89 compiler (C89 was used in favor of
	C99 only to maximize compatibility). Unicode should work fine as long
	as you use UTF8.

Installation

	To run the included unit tests go to /tests and type "make run".
	
	No installation is really required since this entire parser consists of two
	.c and two .h files. Making a library out of this would probably be overkill.
	You can just add these files to your project:

		tml_parser.c
		tml_parser.h
		tml_tokenizer.c
		tml_tokenizer.h

	And you should be all ready to use TML in your project.
