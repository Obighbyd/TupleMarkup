What is TML?

	TML (Tuple Markup Language)
	github.com/judnich/TupleMarkup

	An extremely simple all-purpose markup language: nested lists with 
	bracket-minimizing syntax. It enables XML-like and YAML-like semantics 
	within the same clean and consistent language, plus much more.


What's in this folder? 

	This folder contains a TML parser and document tree API in C++.

	The parser itself is implemented in C (in the "tml-c" folder); this is just a
	simple C++ wrapper around the C functions, providing a more convenient
	interface for C++ programs (using std::string, RIAA, etc.) 

	You can execute "make run" from the tests/ folder to try it out.
